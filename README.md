# Captcha_To_Text
Theory of Handwritten CAPTCHA Solver Project
A handwritten CAPTCHA solver project involves multiple steps, including image generation, preprocessing, model training, and decoding. Here's a detailed explanation of each part:

1. CAPTCHA Generation
CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) images are designed to distinguish human users from bots. For this project, CAPTCHA images are generated using the captcha library in Python. The generated images contain randomly chosen alphanumeric characters.

Key Concepts:

Random Text Generation: Using a combination of uppercase letters and digits to create random strings.
Image Creation: Using libraries like captcha.image.ImageCaptcha to create images with the generated text.
2. Image Preprocessing
To prepare the images for model training, they need to be preprocessed. This typically involves resizing, grayscale conversion, and normalization.

Key Steps:

Resize Images: Ensure all images have the same dimensions (e.g., 100x40 pixels).
Grayscale Conversion: Convert images to grayscale to reduce complexity.
Normalization: Scale pixel values to a range of [0, 1] for better model performance.
3. Model Architecture
The model used for CAPTCHA recognition is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs are effective for image recognition tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images.

Model Components:

Input Layer: Defines the shape of the input image.
Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the images using filters.
MaxPooling Layers: Downsample the image dimensions while retaining important features.
Flatten Layer: Converts 2D feature maps into 1D vectors.
Dense Layers: Fully connected layers that make predictions.
Output Layer: Predicts the characters present in the CAPTCHA.
4. Training the Model
The model is trained on a dataset of CAPTCHA images. The training involves feeding the images and their corresponding labels (the text in the CAPTCHA) to the model. The loss function and optimizer help the model learn to minimize errors in its predictions.

Training Process:

Data Augmentation: Enhances the dataset by applying random transformations to images.
One-Hot Encoding: Converts categorical labels into a format suitable for training.
Validation Split: Splits the dataset into training and validation sets to monitor model performance.
5. Decoding New CAPTCHAs
Once the model is trained, it can be used to decode new CAPTCHA images. The new image is preprocessed in the same way as the training images and passed through the trained model to predict the characters.

Decoding Process:

Preprocess the Image: Ensure the new image is in the correct format.
Model Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the characters.
Post-Processing: Convert the model's output (a sequence of probabilities) into readable text.
